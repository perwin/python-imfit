python-imfit's is a python package containing bindings for Imfit, a program for
fitting astronomical images developed by Peter Erwin <erwin@mpe.mpg.de>.

This package depends on a
`modified version of Imfit <https://github.com/streeto/Imfit>`_, which exposes
its internal API. Go to the webpage for the
`original version <http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~erwin/code/imfit/>`_ for the latest
